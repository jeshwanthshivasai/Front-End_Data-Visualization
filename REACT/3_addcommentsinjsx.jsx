//JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript.
//Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code.
//Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.

//To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax 
{/*hello world*/} //to wrap around the comment text.

const JSX = (
    <div>
      <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
      <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
      {/*hello world*/}
    </div>
);
